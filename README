## War: The code should contain a list of all 52 cards written out,
## with theier number and ascii suit symbol.
## Next, it randomly selects 26 cards and places them into a player's deck,
## while doing the same for an "AI" deck.
## After that, it begins a while loop where it keeps checking the cards,
## numeric value by seeing if the correlating string is present,
## and then determining which card is higher.
## If it is the player's card, both players cards are placed,
## within another list for the player, and vice versa for the opponent.
## However, if both cards are equal, that triggers a "war" where,
## three cards are randomly chosen and placed inside a seperate war list,
## the next card drawn determines who wins the war and receives all the cards,
## for their secondary list.
